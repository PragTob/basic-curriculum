## Important

It is important that you select the instructions specific to your operating system - the commands you need to run on a Windows computer are slightly different to Mac or Linux. 
If you’re having trouble check the Operating System switcher at the bottom of the commands.

# 1. Creating the application

We’re going to create a new Rails app called railsgirls.

First, let’s open a terminal:

* Mac OS X: Open Spotlight, type Terminal and click the Terminal application.
* Windows: Click Start and look for Command Prompt, then click Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails.
* Linux (Ubuntu): Search for Terminal on the dash and click Terminal.

Next, type these commands in the terminal:

    mkdir projects

You can verify that a directory named projects was created by running the list command: `ls`. You should see the projects directory in the output. Now you want to change the directory you are currently in to the projects folder by running:

    cd projects
