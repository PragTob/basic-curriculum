# Rails Girls Berlin App Tutorial

Today, we’ll build together your very first app.
Doing that, you will learn the basics of Ruby of Rails. We’ve prepared it a bit, so you can really focus on understanding what you’re doing.
##What’s the app about?
Basically, it’s an app about this workshop with a map to see where everyone comes from. It’s also a sort of guestbook where attendees can put comments. It’s a very basic one, so you can easily adapt it for other ideas you may have.
If you want to know how the App will look like after you finished the tutorial you can find an example HERE
Have fun coding and don’t forget to ask your coaches when something is unclear ;-)
